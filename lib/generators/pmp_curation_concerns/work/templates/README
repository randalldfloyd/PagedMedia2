===============================================================================

After creating your work you may wish to:

  1. Add custom views:

      Your newly created work's controller extends from
      CurationConcerns::GenericWorksController; This means that it will use the
      views found in CurationConcerns::Engine.root/app/views/curation_concerns/base.

  2. Modify the model, actor, form or presenter.
